NEXT: 
	custom Text (next)
		contains string of text with syntax for colors: <red>you died...</>
		have unordered map of color strings and SDL colors
	Log System (next)
		Several functions for adding types of events to log (attack, death, moving floors, etc...)
		Keep local list of logs that is made public upon end of animations (don't wan't to show attack logs while things are still moving)
		Could sync up with animations somehow but that seems hacky
	Actor Factory
		give it some basic stats
		creates entity and attaches all the correct components
	Doors (and other interactable entities)
		Just don't have active component?

Later:
	AI System
			Create wandering system
		Cleanup
			Every so often check if anything references an entity and destroy it if not (look through AI components for instance) (mark for cleanup upon death?)
	
	Make input code neater/more robust
	Do once over of input thresholds in Game (time since last command, etc...)
	Tie above numbers to the framerate, along with animations;

Ideas:
	Have damage system and damage component
	Resolve damage after each action
	Go through each entity with a damage component
	call an AddDamage function to add damage to entity and provide the attacker

	Have callback functions in animations so that logs can be synced with animations
