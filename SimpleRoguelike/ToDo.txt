# System
-Put in some simple debug tools (click cell to turn it into wall, disable fog of war, etc...)
-Limit getting input somehow (if held down, only get every game logic advance time)
-Change renderer to use tile coordinates to render instead of pixels (will be easier to do UI)

# Interface
-Delete log messages after each turn?
-Cache actors last known positions for when cells are not visible, but known.

# Map Generation
-Make Map generation less hardcoded
-Create door props
-Change props blocking pathfinding and sight to be parameters for each prop (doors will be props, and need to change themselves when open)

# Actor
-Properly implement FSM (currently always set to attack)
-Create functions for calculating values like attack power and damage received, as well as determining if a target is an enemy.
-Implement some sort of action points or stamina system which actors gain each turn.
 This would allow actors to have different movement speeds.
 Some may not act every n turns, while some may move multiple cells at once.
