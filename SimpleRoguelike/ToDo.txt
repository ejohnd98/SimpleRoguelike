NEXT:
	Event System
		When an actor takes an action an additional event is created that contains information about the animation, as well as a corresponding log.
	
	Log System Improvements
		Possibly fixed by above, but logs should update as they happen, or possibly just immediately. Should be divided by player turn? Or just have old logs faded

Later:
	AI System
			Create wandering system
		Cleanup
			Every so often check if anything references an entity and destroy it if not (look through AI components for instance) (mark for cleanup upon death?)
		Smarter pathfinding
			If calculated path's next step is blocked, do an alternate path that avoids other entities

	Tie input thresholds to framerate (move outside game.cpp?)

	Layer system
		either have priority queue (seems costly) or vector of vectors. push render job (create something for) to the correct layer
		fixes doors being above, and also allows z depth for bug textures (appear in front of some walls and behind others)

Ideas:
	Have damage system and damage component
	Resolve damage after each action
	Go through each entity with a damage component
	call an AddDamage function to add damage to entity and provide the attacker
