NEXT:
	Map Generation
		Get possibleWalls working
		Create another category of prefabs that don't connect, but are placed anywhere there is enough floor (ie, could be props down the line)

		At start of generation, place entrance prefab and exit prefab
		also place unique prefabs like stores and altars and bosses

		have different category of prefabs that aren't used in regular mapgen

		Thought: keep track of how many times a prefab is placed (reduce repetitions, and weight it so larger ones are more rare)

	Event System
		When an actor takes an action an additional event is created that contains information about the animation, as well as a corresponding log.
	
	Log System Improvements
		Possibly fixed by above, but logs should update as they happen, or possibly just immediately. Should be divided by player turn? Or just have old logs faded

Later:
	AI System
			Create wandering system
		Cleanup
			Every so often check if anything references an entity and destroy it if not (look through AI components for instance) (mark for cleanup upon death?)

	Tie input thresholds to framerate (move outside game.cpp?)

	Layer system
		either have priority queue (seems costly) or vector of vectors. push render job (create something for) to the correct layer
		fixes doors being above, and also allows z depth for bug textures (appear in front of some walls and behind others)
