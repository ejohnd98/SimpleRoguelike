NEXT: 
	Pathfinding (NEXT)
		Implement pathfinding algorithm (look at code before refactor)
		Have AI default target player while FoV isn't in
	Field of View (NEXT)
		CalculateVisibleCells (entity, map)
			fills out a bool array of visible/not visible for given entity(OR fill in array in map component?)
		GetVisibleEntities (entity, map)
			creates a list of entities within certain range, then trims down to entities with line of sight
		HasLineOfSight (entity, entity, map)
			returns true if 2 entities have line of sight
		Create function that takes in 
	AI System
		Flesh out as functionality becomes available
	TurnSystem Debts
		determines debt value from entity stats
	Entity stats
		create components to give entities some base stats (hp, pwr, mag, def, res, spd, lck)

	Allow sprites of varying sizes to be rendered (bigger than standard tiles)
	Auto load tilesets in folder and store in a map by name

Later:
	Create FX entities (ex. temporary flames during an attack, hit effects, or ailment effects like poison)
		FX system with an FX component. Checks to see if animation is done and if so, erases component
	Make input code neater/more robust
	Do once over of input thresholds in Game (time since last command, etc...)
	Tie above numbers to the framerate, along with animations;
