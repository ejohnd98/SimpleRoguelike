NEXT:
	Event System
		When an actor takes an action an additional event is created that contains information about the animation, as well as a corresponding log.
	Log System (next)
		Several functions for adding types of events to log (attack, death, moving floors, etc...)
		Keep local list of logs that is made public upon end of animations (don't wan't to show attack logs while things are still moving)
		Could sync up with animations somehow but that seems hacky

Later:
	AI System
			Create wandering system
		Cleanup
			Every so often check if anything references an entity and destroy it if not (look through AI components for instance) (mark for cleanup upon death?)
	
	Tie input thresholds to framerate (move outside game.cpp?)

Ideas:
	Have damage system and damage component
	Resolve damage after each action
	Go through each entity with a damage component
	call an AddDamage function to add damage to entity and provide the attacker
