-Delete log messages after each turn?
-Cache actors last known positions for when cells are not visible, but known.
-Put in some simple debug tools (click cell to turn it into wall, disable fog of war, etc...)
-Limit getting input somehow (if held down, only get every game logic advance time)
-Change renderer to use tile coordinates to render instead of pixels (will be easier to do UI)

-Make Map generation less hardcoded
-Figure out good way to populate dungeon (use RoomInfo vector, as well as a floodfill to place exit and entrance + player)
-Create door props
-Change props blocking pathfinding and sight to be parameters for each prop (doors will be props, and need to change themselves when open)
