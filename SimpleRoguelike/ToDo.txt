NEXT: 
	Field of View (NEXT)
		CalculateVisibleCells (entity, map)
			fills out a bool array of visible/not visible for given entity(OR fill in array in map component?)
		GetVisibleEntities (entity, map)
			creates a list of entities within certain range, then trims down to entities with line of sight
		HasLineOfSight (entity, entity, map)
			TOUCH UP FUNCTION
	AI System
		Flesh out as functionality becomes available
	Actor Factory
		give it some basic stats
		creates entity and attaches all the correct components

	Allow sprites of varying sizes to be rendered (bigger than standard tiles)
	Auto load tilesets in folder and store in a map by name

Later:
	Create FX entities (ex. temporary flames during an attack, hit effects, or ailment effects like poison)
		FX system with an FX component. Checks to see if animation is done and if so, erases component
	Make input code neater/more robust
	Do once over of input thresholds in Game (time since last command, etc...)
	Tie above numbers to the framerate, along with animations;

Bugs:
	player animation should always be shown first (since it is their turn to act)
		Keep completely indpendant of other animations maybe?

Ideas:
	Have damage system and damage component
	Resolve damage after each action
	Go through each entity with a damage component
	call an AddDamage function to add damage to entity and provide the attacker

	Allow creation of new entities with animation system (ie. attack anim fx)
