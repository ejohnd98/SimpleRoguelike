NEXT: MOVE ANIMATIONS (TOP PRIORITY)
	Create animation system (new design)
		Any entity that can animate has Animation component
		Also has component specific to animation (idle, moving, attack)

		Renderer loops through all entities with Animation component and handles animation in order of priority (Move is more important than idle)
		each step it moves progress variable in animation forward
		if not set to loop, remove component after progress is done

		When moving an entity, add MoveAnim component to entity
		Also keep track of pending animations in Renderer (list of enum AnimType). Add to when adding these components.
		When the added AnimType is different to last one (ie, adding attack when last was move) then store that new one somewhere
			then, set a flag so Game remains in Animating state. Once anim are done playing, clear queue and add AnimType that triggered the pause

	Allow sprites of varying sizes to be rendered (bigger than standard tiles)
	Auto load tilesets in folder and store in a map by name

Later:
	Create FX entities (ex. temporary flames during an attack, hit effects, or ailment effects like poison)
		FX system with an FX component. Checks to see if animation is done and if so, erases component
