Each entity has action debt (starts at 0)
different actions cost different amounts

Each logic update: (10 per second)
	While player cannot act:
		increment turn counter by 10:
			check if any actors have 0 debt and let them act (speed breaks ties)
			subtract 10 from each actor's debt.

Each render update: (60fps)
	Loop through and render map tiles
